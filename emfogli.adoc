## Git Branch Strategy

image::GitBranchDiagram.png[alt=gitBranchDiagram,width=500px][orientation=portrait]

- My Git Branch Strategy begins with my local environment.

- When files have been modified, they are uploaded to GitHub via GitBash.

- GitBash places the files in the Dev Branch.

- A Pull Request is created.

- The Pull Request is reviewed, by myself or with a peer.

- Modifications are accepted/denied and pushed onto the Dev Branch.

- The final version is pushed onto the Master Branch.

## Implementation Strategy

- My Implementation strategy begins with the development process.

** This process consists of changes to files via Atom and constant testing via Atom's Live Server.

- Once modifications are finished, the files move to the Git Branch Strategy (see above).

- Changes are then made live through FileZilla.

- Point Park University's Servers host the live webpage.

- It is then verified, in which I determine if more modifications are necessary at this time.
